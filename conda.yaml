  # If available, always prefer the conda version of a package, installation will be faster and more efficient.

  - pip:
    # Define pip packages here.

    - rpaframework==16.3.0 # https://rpaframework.org/releasenotes.html

    # As you see, there are no other dependencies listed out here beside
    #  `rpaframework`. Therefore the additional deps coming from private sources (like
    #  Robocorp's read-only non-sensitive PyPI, user's private repo or local source)
    #  will be installed by the pre-run script triggering the pip installation of the
    #  listed private deps from the requirements-private.txt file.
